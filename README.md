# Restaurant-Project
This project aims to revolutionize the security and decentralization of user access for restaurant platforms. 
By leveraging blockchain technology, we've developed a robust authentication system that ensures the integrity and confidentiality of user credentials.
## Features
### Blockchain-Powered Security:
User authentication data, including email and password information, is stored on a secure and decentralized blockchain.
The blockchain's immutability enhances security by preventing unauthorized tampering with user credentials.
### Middleware API Server:
An intermediary API server facilitates seamless communication between the restaurant platform and the blockchain.
The API server manages user authentication requests, interacts with smart contracts on the blockchain, and ensures a decentralized approach to identity verification.
### Smart Contract Implementation:
Smart contracts deployed on the blockchain govern user registration, login, and password management processes.
These contracts provide a trustless and transparent mechanism for verifying user identities while maintaining decentralization.
